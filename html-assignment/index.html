        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me:</h2>
        <p>I was born in the year 2003 on October 16<sup>th</sup>. I am an only child in my household, <strong>but</strong> I do have a sister who is 17 years older than me. As of right now I have three nephews and a dog named Barley. I went to Elementary school at Roberta Bondar Public School for 9 years which included Kindergarten. Once I finished grade 8 I was off to Hillcrest High School which is where I made most of my friends. Because of <strong>COVID</strong> I can't consistently meet up with them but we enjoy our time chatting online.</p>
        <p>When it comes down to my hobbies, in the winter I enjoy snowboading and curling! As for the summer, I don't do a whole lot. I either stay inside playing games and chatting with friends, or I make an arrangement to have an outing with some friends. Of course that doesn't happen a whole lot because I'm bad at arranging outings... Whenever I'm the 
        only one around I play games Like <em>Destiny 2</em> or <em>Terraria</em> and plenty more. <em>Destiny 2</em>, as of right now is my all time favourite game, beating out all the other games I've played ever since I was born. 
        The reason why <em>Destiny 2</em> is my favorite game is because I can actually tell that I am improving. I always tell myself: 
        <q>We all start somewhere, some lower than others, but with enough practice you can achieve great heights! You can't get better if you never try your hardest. -<cite> Myself :D</cite></q> I always tell this to myself and my friends to keep them motivated in playing <em>Destiny 2</em>, because games are much better with friends.</p>
